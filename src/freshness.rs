//! Making a fresh checkout's unchanged files look as old as the base they
//! fork from, without ever hiding a real change from Cargo.
//!
//! Cargo decides freshness by comparing source mtimes with its fingerprint
//! files. A new worktree gets "now" as the mtime of every file, so without
//! intervention every crate looks dirty. Ferry sets ("stamps") the mtime of a
//! file to [`STAMP_SECS`] — far older than any base artifact — but only when
//! that file is proven byte-identical to the file the base compiled. Any file
//! that differs keeps its real (new) mtime, so Cargo rebuilds what depends on
//! it.
//!
//! INVARIANT: a file is stamped only if all of the following hold:
//! 1. it is a tracked regular file at merge stage 0 in the agent's index,
//! 2. the base commit's tree has the same path with the same mode and blob id,
//! 3. the agent's working file and the base checkout's working file have
//!    identical bytes (this catches smudge filters, `core.autocrlf`,
//!    post-checkout hooks, and anything else that makes the working tree
//!    differ from the blob), and
//! 4. its metadata has not changed between verification and stamping, and
//! 5. Cargo cannot reach it through a symlink that leads elsewhere in the
//!    agent than in the base (see `changed_link_regions`).
//!
//! A directory (any ancestor of a tracked path, up to and including the
//! worktree root) is stamped only if its entry names equal those of the same
//! directory in the base checkout, and condition 5 holds for it. Cargo's
//! `rerun-if-changed=<dir>` takes the recursive max mtime of the directory,
//! its subdirectories and files, and a deleted file is only visible as its
//! parent directory's mtime change.
//!
//! Leaving a file unstamped makes Cargo rebuild only where it compares
//! mtimes. With checksum freshness it compares content, and a file reached
//! through a changed symlink is identical to the base's, so the units that
//! read one also get their dep-info invalidated ([`link_rebuilds`]).
//!
//! [`StampPlan`] can only be constructed by [`plan`], so code elsewhere cannot
//! stamp an unverified path. Stamping happens once, when an agent is
//! spawned: re-stamping a tree an agent has worked in would hide deletions.
